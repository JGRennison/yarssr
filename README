This is a fork of the original (v0.2.2) from http://yarssr.sf.net with the following changes:
* Apply patches from Debian up to v0.2.2-9
* Remove dangerous chmods in make install target.
* Fix make uninstall target leaving locale files behind, and not using DESTDIR.
* Replace Atom parser with a more correct XML::LibXML implementation, to fix various Atom parsing bugs.
* Do downloads asynchronously and in parallel using AnyEvent::HTTP instead of using Gnome VFS.
* Only re-download feeds if they have changed since the last download, using the If-Modified-Since header.
* Fix favicon downloads uing the wrong URL on HTTPS domains.
* Support extracting icon URLs from RSS and Atom feeds, and if not try a PNG favicon URL as well as an ICO one.
* Make writes to the config file, saved feed state files and icon files atomic
* Use RSS GUID and Atom ID for more reliable detection of existing feed items, and support updating the title and URL of existing feed items
* Fix harmless segfault on exit.
* Fix incorrect screen placement of tray icon right-click menu.

Check INSTALL file for installation directions.

Just run 'yarssr'. Wait while it retrieves the RSS feeds,
and then displays them in the tray. Preferences allows you
to add feeds and adjust the interval time.

If you have problems upgrading from an old version of Yarssr, it is
recommended that you delete your ~/.yarssr directory.

Improvements welcome.
