Original Author: Lee Aylward <lee@laylward.com>

This is a fork of the original (v0.2.2) from http://yarssr.sf.net with the following changes:
* Apply patches from Debian up to v0.2.2-9
* Remove dangerous chmods in make install target.
* Replace Atom parser with a more correct XML::LibXML implementation, to fix various Atom parsing bugs.
* Do downloads asynchronously and in parallel using AnyEvent::HTTP instead of using Gnome VFS.
* Only re-download feeds if they have changed since the last download, using the If-Modified-Since header.
* Fix favicon downloads uing the wrong URL on HTTPS domains.

Check INSTALL file for installation directions.

Just run 'yarssr'. Wait while it retrieves the RSS feeds,
and then displays them in the tray. Preferences allows you
to add feeds and adjust the interval time.

If you have problems upgrading from an old version of Yarssr, it is
recommended that you delete your ~/.yarssr directory.

Improvements welcome.
